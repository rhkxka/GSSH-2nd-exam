LIKEWISE WE CAN SOLVE PLASTIC POLLUTION AFTER DOING TECHNICAL RESEARCH AND SUPPORTING THIS HELLO MY NAME IS LEE YOUN JUN I PRESENTATION ABOUT THE EGG CHALLENGE THOUGHT EXPERIMENT SO I SUPPOSE THIS IS THE MAX DROP HEIGHT IN WHICH THE EGG DOESNT BREAK THE LIFT AND THE GRAVITY ARE ACTING ON A FALLING EGG THE LIFT IS CALCULATED USING FLUID DENSITY THE OBJECTS SPEED CROSSSECTIONAL AREA AND LIFT COEFFICIENT I USED GEOGEBRA TO CALCULATE LIFT USING THE EGGS CROSSSECTIONAL AREA AND THE GRAVITY EQUATES TO THE OBJECTS WEIGHT N THE MORE THE EGG FALLS THE MORE THE EGGS SPEED AND LIFT INCREASE WHEN THE LIFT EQUATES TO GRAVITY THE VELOCITY IS CONSTANT AND THIS VELOCITY IS TERMINAL VELOCITY I CALCULATED THE IMPULSIVE FORCE OF THE EGG ON THE GROUND WHEN IT IS DROPPED FROM CM USING PYTHON THE IMPULSIVE FORCE IS N
