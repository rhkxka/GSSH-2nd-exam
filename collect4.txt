THIS WHICH I DESIGNED IS THE HANGLE PLANE WHICH PROTECTS THE EGG THE EGG IS IN THIS BOX I WILL MAKE THE PLANE USING A HARDBOARD SPRING AND WHEEL I INSTALL THE SUPPORT IN THE BOX TO PREVENT THE EGG FROM CRACKING I CALCULATE THE FORCE ACTING ON THE PLANE ON THE VERTICAL DIRECTION LIFT AND GRAVITY ACT I FIGURED OUT LIFT AND GRAVITY USING CROSSSECTIONAL AREA AND MATERIAL WEIGHTS ON PARALLEL DIRECTION DRAG AND THRUST ACT DRAGS FORMULA EQUATES TO LIFTS SO I CALCULATED DRAG IN THE SAME WAY AS THE LIFT AND I FIGURE OUT NET FORCE IN EACH DIRECTION USING THESE I WANTED TO PROVE EGG IS SAFE BUT I DIDNT BECAUSE I CANT KNOW ABOUT THE SPRING CONSTANT AND THE COEFFICIENT OF FRICTION THE EGG BOX REACHES THE GROUND SLOWLY BECAUSE OF SPRINGS IN THIS PROCESS THE PLANES ENERGY IS TRANSDUCED SPRING ENERGY AND WORKING BY THE FRICTIONAL FORCE EVENTUALLY THE POWER WHICH THE EGG RECEIVES BECOMES LITTLE THAN N SO THE EGG WILL NOT BREAK
